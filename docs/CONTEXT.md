# Context Log

Rolling session journal. Newest entry on top. Read the top entry to know
exactly where the project stands; read `docs/TODO.md` to know what is next.

Update this at the end of every working session — a session that ends without
an entry here costs the next one twenty minutes of rediscovery.

## Current state

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Phase** | 0 — Foundations, in progress |
| **Runnable?** | No. No application code exists yet. |
| **Repo** | Local git initialised. Remote `https://github.com/Rupin-Gupta/Ticket-Booking.git` — **not pushed yet, user pushes** |
| **Blocked on** | Nothing |
| **Next action** | Scaffold npm workspaces: `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/shared` |

Accounts still to create when Phase 0 scaffolding is done: Neon (Postgres),
Upstash (Redis), Resend (email). None are needed to write the scaffolding.

## 2026-08-22 — Session 1: planning and docs

**Did**

- Read the brief and `CLAUDE.md`; confirmed stack and the fifteen
  non-negotiable rules as given, no changes proposed.
- Wrote the documentation set: `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `docs/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/RULES.md`,
  `docs/DEBUGGING.md`, `docs/TODO.md`, `docs/API.md`.
- Published the **Ticket Booking Blueprint** artifact — visual walkthrough of
  the seat lifecycle, concurrency mechanism, waitlist flow, and build phases.
  Source lives at `docs/blueprint.html`, republishable to the same URL.
- `git init`, `.gitignore`, first commit. Not pushed — user pushes.

**Decided**

- Postgres-only seat locking, no Redis lock. See ADR-001.
- `OFFERED` as a first-class seat status, distinct from `HELD`. ADR-002.
- Lazy expiry as the correctness guarantee, sweeper as the UX guarantee. ADR-003.
- Email queued through BullMQ, never inline in the request. ADR-005.

**Open questions for the user**

- Resend vs Gmail SMTP for the email provider — Resend assumed; needs a domain
  or the shared sandbox sender. Confirm before Phase 4.
- Is a payment step wanted anywhere? The brief does not ask for one; assumed no.

**Next session starts with**

Phase 0 scaffolding — workspaces, TS config, Express + Vite skeletons. Nothing
needs a hosted account yet.
